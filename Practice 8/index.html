				<p class="text">Samosa Sweet Potatoes Wraps<br> <br>When we travel, we often make wraps to bring with us as a meal during our trip. They tend to be way more wholesome and delicious than the fast (and often expensive) options that are available at the airport or train station.
				<br><br>
				 Like most of our dishes, it's all about the toppings, and I think it's a must to have some sliced avocado, or at least a creamy dressing like our cashew lime or avocado garlic cream. I also like my wraps to be a bit more spicy with a little squirt of sriracha or a dollop of our Afghan Green Chutney. <br><br> These savoury wraps are easy to make and assemble the night before, just pop them in the microwave the next morning, and you are good to go (adding the avocado after it's been heated, preferably)! You can also make the fillings ahead of time and assemble the next day. <br><br>INGREDIENTS: Sweet Potatoes 2 sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into <br>1-inch cubes <br>1/4 cup (40 g) frozen peas <br>1 tsp (5 ml) coconut oil <br>1/2 tsp ground cumin <br>1/2 tsp ground coriander <br>1/2 tsp turmeric powder <br>1/2 tsp dried fenugreek leaves (optional) <br>Salt and pepper to taste <br><br>INGREDIENTS: Tofu Scramble <br>1 block (225 g) medium, firm, or extra-firm tofu <br>1 small onion, diced <br>1 tsp (5 ml) coconut oil <br>1 tsp turmeric <br>1 tsp nutritional yeast <br>1 tsp garlic powder <br>Salt and pepper to taste <br><br>INGREDIENTS: Wrap <br>Sliced red bell pepper <br>Sliced avocado <br>Whole wheat wraps</p>
